When you create a new donation line, if you select a mass product,
you can specify the mass intention. If the donor wants the mass to be
celebrated by a particular celebrant, you can also specify a celebrant
on the donation line (otherwise, leave empty). If the donor wants the
mass to be celebrated at a particular date, you can also specify a
Celebration Requested Date on the donation line (otherwise, leave empty).

When the donation is validated, the mass request is automatically created. You can jump on it via an icon/button at the top right of the donation form view.
