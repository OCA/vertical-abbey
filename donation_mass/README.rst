This module adds the ability to create mass requests from donation
lines.

When a donation is validated with a mass in one of the donation lines,
a new mass request is automatically created and the account move
associated to the donation will send the amount of that donation line
to a stock account. When the mass is celebrated, i.e. when the mass
is validated in Odoo, an accounting entry is generated from the stock
account to a revenue account.

Configuration
=============

Check that the mass products have the option *Is a Donation* active.

On the Invoicing configuration page, in the *Mass* section, the *Mass Stock Account* is the account that is used when validating the donation.

On the mass product, the *Income Account* is used when the mass journal is validated.

Usage
=====

When you create a new donation line, if you select a mass product,
you can specify the mass intention. If the donor wants the mass to be
celebrated by a particular celebrant, you can also specify a celebrant
on the donation line (otherwise, leave empty). If the donor wants the
mass to be celebrated at a particular date, you can also specify a
Celebration Requested Date on the donation line (otherwise, leave empty).

When the donation is validated, the mass request is automatically created. You can jump on it via an icon/button at the top right of the donation form view.
